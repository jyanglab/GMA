Description: As a causal inference method, genome-wide mediation analysis (GMA) is proven to be a powerful tool to complement the widely used genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). 
    GMA can identify SNPs directly affecting the final phenotype or indirectly through intermediate Omics data mediation. 
    If considering transcriptomics data as the intermediate trait, this method can pinpoint specific genes as the transcriptional mediators to connect genotype with phenotype. 
    The results from GMA, therefore, provide an explicit causation hypothesis for downstream functional study. 
    This R software package is implemented to perform GMA.
